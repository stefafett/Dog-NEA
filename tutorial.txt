hi!
welcome to the tutorial.
to win the game you must do better in one these categories:
intelligence, this is measured between 1 and 100, the highest score wins
exercise, this is meashured between 1 and 10, the highest score wins
friendliness, this is measured between 1 and 10, the highest score wins
drool, this is heasured between 1 and 10, the lowest score wins the round

this is a round based game. the player starts by picking a catagorie and if the player wins the player pickes again.
but if the computer wins last round the computer picks the catagory randomly.

good luck player and have fun!
